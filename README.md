# Capital Mobile Team Technical Challenge

Welcome to Capital!
This test will serve to inform us a little more about your technical skills in application development with React Native. A few days after finishing the challenge, we'll send you feedback with our impressions and a possible invitation to a more detailed conversation about the decisions you made during development.
It is worth remembering that here at Capital we value the quality of our users' experience and the quality of the code we produce. Applying good programming practices is a rule for us ;)

# First steps

Fork this repository, it will be essential for its delivery, which will be by Pull Request.

# The problem

We need to build a brief application to be able to visualize various superheroes! For this we will have an API that you will have to query and display this data.

# The challenge

It is necessary to build the application respecting the [layout](https://www.figma.com/file/5xCQrJgc0swuNY4q2Ahbif/Challenge---SuperHero?node-id=0%3A1&t=oMmVapuFDUlK7hze-1), the code base will be built entirely by you. Remember, the clearer your code and decisions are to our recruiting team, the better you will perform on the assessment.

# Technical requirements

The API is available here: https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/
Use the following technologies:
* react-native
* TypeScript
* NPM
* [Airbnb TypeScript Pattern](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript)

# Evaluation

As you can imagine, we will evaluate both the creative capability of the technical solution (using context, graphql, etc) and the usability of the application. You can feel free to spice things up.

# submission
